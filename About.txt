Convert a 99999_SEQ_Final_yyyy-mm-dd.txt file into the RAW format

- BASICS -

	If you have a desktop shortcut to the program, click it and follow prompts.

	If not, navigate to your DNASequence folder, double click Run.jar and follow prompts.

- INPUT -
	
	The user is prompted for the file name.

	Assumptions:
		The file has not been tampered with.
		The file is the standard type: 99999_SEQ_Final_yyyy-mm-dd.txt
		The file matches the Patent Office format in the
		PatentIn program as at 5 November 2014. If this
		format changes, contact Ryan Petrosky.

- POSSIBLE RESULTS -

	A. UNABLE TO ACCEPT INPUT FORMAT
		The input file contains an unaccounted for format. Some sequences
		may be partially present in the output file. The output file will
		contain errors. If the input file has been tampered with, please
		retry with an unaltered version. If the patent office layout has
		changed, please contact Ryan Petrosky to update this program.

	B. SUCCESS
		The output file will be saved to the same folder the input file
		resides, with the modification "_SEQ_RAW_madebyryan.txt" added
		to the input file name.

	C. NO INPUT FILE RECIEVED
		An input file was not detected.

	D. RAW FILE ALREADY IN EXISTENCE
		The generic output name created by adding "_SEQ_RAW_madebyryan.txt"
		to the input file is a pre-existing file. The program is designed
		not to override	pre-existing files.

	E. SEQUENCES NOT READABLE
		The program could not locate field <160> indicating the number of
		sequences in the file, causing zero sequences to be read. No output
		file created.

- USABILITY -
	
	This program was tested using the Java JRE 1.8.x_xx and found acceptable. Though 
	there will exist some degree of backward compatibility, none is guaranteed with
	older JRE versions.
	
	The DNASequence folder must contain these files for proper functionality:
		ReverseMain.java
		ReverseMain.class
		ReverseMain$1.class
		ReverseSequence.java
		ReverseSequence.class
		Sequence.java
		Sequence.class
		Manifest.txt
		Run.jar
